Reports beginning in 2023 are generated using csasdown (https://github.com/pbs-assess/csasdown), e.g.: `csasdown::draft(type="techreport", directory="report/2023_biochemop_TechReport")`.  

*Note that in the 2023 report, the "LAS" polygon used for satellite data was renamed "HB" or "Hamilton Bank" to be consistent with AZMP reporting.*
